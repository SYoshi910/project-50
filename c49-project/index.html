                    <li>Camels are HUGE. I rode one once. They are big</li>
                    <li>Camels are in places like Egypt or other deserts.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Teddy bears are things 4 year olds get when they are lonely and need a friend. We were all there at one point. :(</li>
                    <li>In Toy Story, Teddy Bears move and talk. You never know what they'll say about you when you leave the room.</li>
                    <li>Teddy bears were named after Teddy Roosevelt, who saved a bear from hunters and therefore had toy bears named after him. This is the only useful fact on this list!</li>

                    <li>Pandas really like bamboo, even though they could get better nutrition eating something better than bamboo. They spend all day munching away.</li>
                    <li>Pandas can be funny sometimes.</li>
